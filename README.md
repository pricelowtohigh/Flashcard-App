Frontend Capstone: Flashcard App

Capstone project for frontend portion of Thinkful coding bootcamp. 

Basic REST API application that allows for the creation, deletion, viewing and editing of flashcards "decks" using Javascript React and Bootstrap 4. Each "deck" is made up of at least 3 "cards", each card having a front and back side. The user can select the "study" function for a particular deck which defaults to showing the front side of each card. The user can then "flip" the card to check their knowledge of whatever topic it covers before proceeding to the next card.

The project makes use of Reacts functional component structure and routing abilities to create a dynamic and modular application.
